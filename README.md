## Why I Chose Flying Etiquette Question/What Data Was Revealed 

I found the question "On a 6 hour flight from NYC to LA, how many times is it acceptable to get up if you're not in an aisle seat?" interesting because I have been on a few flights and have had different experiences. At times, I observe very few people getting up from their seats, while other times it feels as though everyone is getting up. Some people find it annoying especially when you have to twist your body around, move your legs, or maybe even lift up the tray table in the middle of drinking or eating a snack. Other people don't mind it, some people sleep on flights, others read, listen to music, get some work done, watch a movie, and much more. Nonetheless, the data I found is that of 1,040 participants, the majority, 296 people (or 27.5%), say 3 times is acceptable. On the other hand, only 13 people (1.25%) said it is not acceptable at all which means 98.75% of the participants agree that it is acceptable to get up at the very least, once.
